# ComboBox Bug Demo
Example code for [this stack overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40976884/cannot-save-value-from-target-back-to-source-bindingexpressionpath-isdropdowno).

Here's a short video showing the problem. Note the keypresses are shown in the bottom left of the screen. The problem doesn't seem to occur when using only the mouse.
